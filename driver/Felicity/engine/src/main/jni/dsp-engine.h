/**
 * @file dsp-engine.h
 * @brief Public interface and aggregate state for the Felicity native DSP processing engine.
 *
 * Defines [DspContext], which owns all biquad filter state, effect parameters, and the
 * mono downmix scratch buffer that feeds the visualizer FFT.
 *
 * The full DSP chain applied by [nativeProcessAudio] is, in order:
 *   1. 10-band peaking EQ (ISO standard center frequencies, RBJ biquad) — gated by [eqEnabled]
 *   2. Bass low-shelf filter (250 Hz, S = 1) — always active, independent of [eqEnabled]
 *   3. Treble high-shelf filter (4000 Hz, S = 1) — always active, independent of [eqEnabled]
 *   4. Stereo widening via M/S matrix
 *   5. Constant-power pan / balance
 *   6. Tape-style soft saturation via algebraic sigmoid
 *   7. Mono downmix accumulation → visualizer FFT trigger

 * engine applies the pre-computed Hann window, runs the PFFFT forward transform, computes
 * per-band RMS magnitudes, and stores them in [bandMagnitudes]. Kotlin can then call
 * [nativeDspReadBandMagnitudes] to atomically copy those magnitudes into its own buffer.

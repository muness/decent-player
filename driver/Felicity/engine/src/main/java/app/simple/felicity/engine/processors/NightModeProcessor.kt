/**
 * An [AudioProcessor] that applies a stereo-linked dynamic range compressor tuned for
 * comfortable late-night listening.
 *
 * Algorithm overview:
 *  1. A stereo frame (L + R) is read together so both channels share one gain value.
 *  2. An envelope follower smooths the peak level (max of |L|, |R|) using fast attack /
 *     slow release coefficients. Deriving gain from the smoothed envelope — not from the
 *     raw sample — prevents the gain from oscillating at audio frequency across every
 *     zero crossing, which would produce near-zero net compression.
 *  3. Above the threshold the gain is reduced by the configured ratio (hard-knee).
 *  4. A makeup gain is applied after compression so quiet passages come up to a
 *     comfortable audible level.
 *  5. A brick-wall clamp at ±1.0 guards against the brief overshoot that happens
 *     during the attack ramp before the envelope has caught up to a new loud transient.
 *     This behaves as a transparent mastering limiter — the transient is caught within
 *     the 7 ms attack window and is essentially inaudible.
 *
 * Parameter derivation (48 kHz sample rate):
 *  - attackCoef  = 1 − exp(−1 / (48000 × 0.007)) ≈ 0.00300  → ≈7 ms attack
 *  - releaseCoef = 1 − exp(−1 / (48000 × 0.350)) ≈ 0.0000595 → ≈350 ms release
 *
 * Makeup gain budget (no clipping within normal operating range):
 *  At full-scale input (envelope = 1.0): compressed amplitude = 0.1 + 0.9/8 = 0.2125
 *  makeupGain = 3.0 → peak output = 0.2125 × 3.0 = 0.638 (≈ −4 dBFS, safe headroom).
 *
 * Supports all four PCM encodings via [PcmUtils].

/**
 * @file usb-audio-output.h
 * @brief Direct USB audio output context for bit-perfect playback.
 *
 * Pipeline architecture:
 * - Pre-allocated ring buffer of 64 URB slots
 * - Each URB = 8 ISO packets (1ms of audio at high-speed)
 * - Completions are matched to their slot by URB pointer, so a host
 *   controller that retires URBs out of order cannot desync the ring
 * - No malloc/free during streaming — avoids MTE pointer tag issues

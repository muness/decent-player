/**
 * Central manager for all bundled Milkdrop preset assets.
 *
 * Presets are stored under `assets/presets/` and may span any number of
 * subdirectories (currently `points/` and `spectrum/`).  New directories added
 * to the assets tree are picked up automatically without any code change — the
 * only root that is hard-coded here is [PRESETS_ROOT].
 *
 * The full preset list is computed once and cached in memory so that repeated calls
 * from [MilkdropViewModel][app.simple.felicity.viewmodels.panels.MilkdropViewModel]
 * and [MilkdropPresetsViewModel][app.simple.felicity.viewmodels.dialogs.MilkdropPresetsViewModel]
 * both hit the same result without rescanning the asset filesystem.
 *
 * To invalidate the cache (e.g., in tests), call [clearCache].
